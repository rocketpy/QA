# Note the shell section:

shell: python tasks.py

# In this case, we tell Python to run the tasks.py file. You can customize the command for your needs.

# For comparison, the typical Robot Framework command looks like this:

shell: python -m robot --report NONE --outputdir output --logtitle "Task log" tasks.robot

# In this case, we tell Python to run the robot module (python -m robot) with arguments.
