Fixtures:
    browser:
        Get the splinterâ€™s Browser. Fixture is underneath session scoped, so browser process is started once per test session,
        but the state of the browser will be clean (current page is blank, cookies clean).
    session_browser:
        The same as browser except the lifetime. This fixture is session-scoped so will only be finalized at the end of the whole test session.
        Useful if you want to speedup your test suite paying with reduced test isolation.
    browser_instance_getter:
        Function to create an instance of the browser.
        This fixture is required only if you need to have multiple instances of the Browser in a single test at the same time. Example of usage.
